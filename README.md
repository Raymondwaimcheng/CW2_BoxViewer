# CW2_BoxViewer
## Description
  CW2 of COMP3016
  This project uses OpenGL to create something.
  My goal is to create a controllable object viewer like game engine scene viewer.
  Adding keyboard control for the user to control the object when the program is running, E.g. Color switching, Change rotation, Shader swapping.
